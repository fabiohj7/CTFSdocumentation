CRYPTOGRAPHY

1. For the first batch of cryptography challenges I used Cyberchef. Very simple copying and pasting.

2. For the second batch I used dCode which was also some copying and pasting. Also, some researching trying to find the right cipher.

3. Third batch, the first question shows a cipher that is a https link and has some hex characters in between some other characters.


PASSWORD CRACKING

1. For this group of challenges we were given a password, and I just needed to get a MD5 hash for it.
I just looked for a website that would help me do this.

2. For the second group of challenges I was given a list of hashes and I needed to crack them. I used 'hash-identifier' to get the hash type.
Then, I used hashcat to get the passwords.

3. Windows hash cracking, for the first two challenges I used a free website that would give me the passwords but it did not work for the last one.
For the last one I used ophcrack GUI version and added the free fast xp tables to it, from there just wrote down the hash and got the password.
