# Enumeration & Exploitation Challenges

## Python 1 (Easy)

The challenge is to find an input to this program that will give you the correct validation.

[Python File](python1.py)

Examining the python file I was able to see that the code will convert the input into ASCII code.

Then it gives some conditionals

- It has to be = 1000
- The length has to be = 10
- And the second letter equal to = 83

There are a lot of answers for this flag, but as long as you comply with the conditionals the flag
will work.

My approach to this answer was to write down an array `arr[9]` with the position `arr[1] = 83`.

Then I just placed a number that would be equal to a letter and that adding it to the others would
equal 1000.

## Python 2 (Easy)

The challenge is to find an input to this program that will give you the correct validation.
