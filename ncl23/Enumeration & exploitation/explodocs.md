# Enumeration & Exploitation Challenges

## Python 1 (Easy)

The challenge is to find an input to this program that will give you the correct validation.

[Python File](python1.py)

---

Examining the python file I was able to see that the code will convert the input into ASCII code.

Then it gives some conditionals

- It has to be = 1000
- The length has to be = 10
- And the second letter equal to = 83

There are a lot of answers for this flag, but as long as you comply with the conditionals the flag
will work.

My approach to this answer was to write down an array `arr[9]` with the position `arr[1] = 83`.

Then I just placed a number that would be equal to a letter and that adding it to the others would
equal 1000.

## Python 2 (Easy)

The challenge is to find an input to this program that will give you the correct validation.

[Python File](PYTHON2.pyc)

We are given a .pyc file, which is a compiled version of a pythong file.

To uncompile this file we downloaded python's uncompyle6 tool

To download:
`pip install uncompyle6`

I uncompiled the file in terminal using the following command

`uncompyle6 <PYTHON2.pyc>`

Then I copied the output into a new file

[Uncompiled Python File](decpython2.py)

From the code we can see that there is a list and our input has to be equal to the length of the list.
Then each character of the list is converted to ASCII again, but to every character is adding the value
of 7. Also, if the character is bigger that 'z' it will send the value back to the character 'a'.
To get the flag you input has to be equal to the list.

My approach to this challenge was to reverse the algorithm. I changed the basic operations, instead of adding
I subtracted 7, and change the conditionals so that if the code goes lower than the value of 'a' it would go
directly to the vaue of 'z'.

## Python 3 (Medium)

What is an input to this program that will result in a correct validation

[Python3 File](PYTHON3.pyc)

As we did with python 2 I first uncompiled the code to get a readable python file, using uncompyle6.

The code looked very confusing at first, there were some bit operators that I couldn't understand.
I researched about them and understood them a little more, as I read I decided to create a python file so I
can understand what most of the operators were doing. Doing some debugging I figured out that the
OR operator `~builder` is written twice, which will negate the first one.

The I just reversed all the operators to come up with a number that I can convert from ASCII to character. From there
I moved to pen and paper, and started to come up with letters, numbers, and symbols that would equal to the amount that
the if statement was asking for. I came up with this answer:
`NEAAB15C2d$`

which gave me the correct answer and I used as the flag.

Here is a file I used for debugging and testing.

## Binary (Medium)

We need to break into a program that the hackers have created. You will need to provide the identifier, 7074, as the only argument to the program.

[32-bit version Binary](RE1_32bit)

This one was a very challenging flag.

using the `file` command you can get that this file is a LSB executable.
Which means "assembly".

From this point I went on downloading and researching all th:e tools I could.

I tried first using `cutter`. Cutter is a reverse engineering tool that will show you the assembly code from the file.
After reading the code for a couple of hours I found out that it was written in C and I could understand some of the
commands that were used, thus, understand what was the program doing(partially).

At the end I couldn't understand what was the main function doing so I changed to a different tool.
Tha famously known NSA tool `Ghidra`. Using this tool feels like going back in time, but it is an awesome tool.
It is so good that I was able to reverse engineer the code all the way back to C.

From there it was easier to tell what the code was doing and then getting the flag.
